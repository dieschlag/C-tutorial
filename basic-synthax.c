/*

This file displays elements on C synthax that have not been depicted already in other pages of the tutorial.

In addition, a few new notions are presented:
- Header Files allows to call predefined functions, they are imported using #include
- Statements are the basic building block of the program, ending with a ";", they are executed in a top to bottom order

    // Here commented to prevent aligning from formatters
    // int a=10; if (a>=50) printf("pass"); else printf("fail");
